    "How do you configure gradient boosting on your problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of configuration heuristics were published in the original gradient bosoting papers. These can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Learning rate or shrinkage rate (learning_rate in XGBoost) should be 0.1 or lower\n",
    "2) The depth of the trees (max_depth in XGBoost) should be configures in the range of 2 to 8 where not much benefit is seen in deeper trees\n",
    "3) Row sampling (see references) should be configured in the range of 30% to 80% of the training dataset compared to value of 100% for no sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "These are good starting point while configuring your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good configuring strategy is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Run the default configuration and review plots of the learning curves on the taring and validation datasets\n",
    "2) If the system l;earns quickly, decrease the learning rate or increase the number of trees\n",
    "3) If the system learns slowly, increase the learning rate to be more aggresive and/or decrease the number of trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Owen Zhang, the former number 1 ranked competitor on Kaggle and now CTO at Data Robot proposes an interesting strategy to configure XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "He suggests to set the number of trees to a target value such as 100 or 1000, then tune the learning rate to find the best model. This is an efficient strategy for quickly finding a good model.\n",
